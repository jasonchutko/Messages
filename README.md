Messages
================================

Messages is a recreation of the UI and message storing capabilities of the Messages app included in iOS. It was used as an introduction to CoreData and should be used as a reference to such.

It can show how relationships between different models should be used in CoreData, as well as the use of `NSFetchedResultsController` to fetch and use the data effectively.

Credit goes to     @jessesquires for his wonderful library `MessagesTableViewController` which displays the messages stored by my application in a similar fashion to the official Messages app.
